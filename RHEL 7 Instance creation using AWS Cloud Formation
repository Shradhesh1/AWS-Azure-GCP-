Steps to Create a RHEL 7 Instance Using AWS CloudFormation
Create CloudFormation Template
Create CloudFormation Stack Using the Template
Verify and Access the Instance
Step 1: CloudFormation Template
Here’s a basic YAML CloudFormation template to create an EC2 instance with RHEL 7 in AWS:

yaml
Copy
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
Description: Launch RHEL 7 Instance in AWS

Resources:
  RHEL7Instance:
    Type: AWS::EC2::Instance
    Properties:
      InstanceType: t2.micro  # Choose the instance type you want
      KeyName: my-key-pair    # Name of the SSH key pair to access the instance
      ImageId: ami-0a913d474a9f23179  # RHEL 7 AMI ID, update this to the region-specific ID
      SecurityGroups:
        - Ref: InstanceSecurityGroup  # Use the defined security group below
      AvailabilityZone: us-east-1a  # Set the availability zone (optional)
      Tags:
        - Key: Name
          Value: MyRHEL7Instance  # Name of the instance

  InstanceSecurityGroup:
    Type: AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup
    Properties:
      GroupDescription: Allow SSH and HTTP
      SecurityGroupIngress:
        - IpProtocol: tcp
          FromPort: '22'  # Allow SSH access
          ToPort: '22'
          CidrIp: '0.0.0.0/0'  # Allow SSH from any IP (consider restricting this)
        - IpProtocol: tcp
          FromPort: '80'  # Allow HTTP access
          ToPort: '80'
          CidrIp: '0.0.0.0/0'  # Allow HTTP from any IP
Key Elements in the Template:
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: Specifies the version of the CloudFormation template.
Resources:
RHEL7Instance: The EC2 instance resource that will be launched.
InstanceType: Defines the instance type (e.g., t2.micro for free tier).
KeyName: The SSH key pair you will use to access the instance.
ImageId: The AMI ID for RHEL 7. You will need to find the correct AMI ID for your AWS region. You can get it from the AWS Console or using AWS CLI:
bash
Copy
aws ec2 describe-images --filters "Name=name,Values=RHEL-7.9*"
SecurityGroups: The security group applied to the instance. The security group allows SSH (port 22) and HTTP (port 80) access.
AvailabilityZone: Optional. You can specify the availability zone for the instance.
Tags: Tags help identify your resources. Here, we’ve set the name of the instance to "MyRHEL7Instance".
InstanceSecurityGroup: The security group created to allow SSH (port 22) and HTTP (port 80) traffic.
Step 2: Create CloudFormation Stack
Log in to the AWS Management Console.
Go to CloudFormation in the AWS Management Console.
Click Create Stack and select With new resources (standard).
Choose the Upload a template file option.
Upload the YAML template (rhel7-cloudformation.yml) you created earlier.
Click Next.
Enter a Stack name (e.g., MyRHEL7InstanceStack).
Configure stack options (you can leave the defaults if you don’t need custom settings).
Review the details and click Create stack.
CloudFormation will now create the resources defined in the template (an EC2 instance with RHEL 7, a security group, and any other resources you have defined).

Step 3: Verify and Access the Instance
Monitor the Stack Creation:

You can monitor the creation process in the CloudFormation console.
Once the stack creation is complete, your RHEL 7 EC2 instance will be available.
Access the Instance:

After the stack is created, go to the EC2 Console and find your instance under the "Instances" section.
Check the Public IP or Elastic IP assigned to the instance.
SSH into the instance using the SSH key pair you specified in the template.
For example:

bash
Copy
ssh -i /path/to/your-key-pair.pem ec2-user@<Public-IP>
Replace /path/to/your-key-pair.pem with the path to your SSH key, and <Public-IP> with the actual IP address of the instance.

Important Notes:
AMI ID: The AMI ID for RHEL 7 differs by region, so make sure to use the correct one for your region. You can find the latest RHEL 7 AMI ID for your region from the AWS Marketplace.

Key Pair: You must have an existing SSH key pair in the AWS region where you're creating the instance. If you don't have one, you can create a new key pair in the EC2 console under Key Pairs.

Security Group: The example template opens ports 22 (SSH) and 80 (HTTP). For better security, restrict access to specific IP addresses or ranges for SSH access (e.g., CidrIp: '203.0.113.0/24').

Free Tier: The t2.micro instance type is eligible for the AWS Free Tier if you’re within the limits of the free tier.
